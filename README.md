This project is an interactive web application designed to visualize classic pathfinding and maze generation algorithms in real-time. It provides a hands-on experience for understanding how these algorithms navigate through a grid, find the shortest path, and create complex mazes.

This repository contains the source code for the full tutorial available on YouTube.
‚ú® Features

    Pathfinding Algorithms:

        Dijkstra's Algorithm: Guarantees the shortest path.

        *A Search:** A more efficient version of Dijkstra's.

        Breadth-First Search (BFS): Excellent for unweighted graphs.

        Depth-First Search (DFS): Does not guarantee the shortest path.

    Maze Generation Algorithms:

        Recursive Division: Creates intricate mazes by recursively dividing the grid.

        Binary Tree: A simple and fast algorithm for generating biased mazes.

    Interactive Grid:

        Drag & Drop: Easily move the start and end nodes.

        Create Walls: Click and drag on the grid to draw walls and create your own obstacles.

        Adjustable Speed: Control the visualization speed (Slow, Medium, Fast).

        Clear Board: Reset the grid and start fresh.
